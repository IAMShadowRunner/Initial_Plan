Someone comes to relieve Yabushige from his post at the watch at the castle walls but he kills the man. Someone throws hooks over the wall guarding the castle. Yabushige goes and kills someone else before letting a mysterious man and group of people into the castle. The intruders kill many people. They try to get John and Mariko, who are laying together in bed, but they fight them off. Mariko informs him they are Shinobi, who have come for her. They try to hide but the shinobi plan to blow open their hiding spot. Mariko welcomes the explosion and stands in front of the door just as it explodes. She goes flying and John calls out her name.
